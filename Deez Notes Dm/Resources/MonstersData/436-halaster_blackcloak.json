It can be used as an arcane focus. Whoever is attuned to the *blast scepter* gains resistance to fire and lightning damage and can, as an action, use it to cast *thunderwave* as a 4th-level spell (save DC 16) without expending a spell slot.\nHalaster also wears a *horned ring* (a very rare magic item that requires attunement), which allows an attuned wearer to ignore Undermountain’s magical restrictions (see “Alterations to Magic”).",
