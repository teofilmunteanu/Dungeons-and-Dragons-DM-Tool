A wish spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.\nA greater restoration spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.\nSomeone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad.",
